Just a simple tool that uses [gifshot][] to convert MP4 files into
animated GIFs.

Why did I make this?

* I wanted an excuse to play around with making animated
  GIFs on the Web.
* The tool I use to do quick video capture on OS X and Windows,
  [Snagit][], supports exporting videos to MP4 but not animated GIF.
